### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

Resolve the driver skill through [poteto-mode's Non-negotiables](../SKILL.md#non-negotiables).

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run `playbooks/prototype.md` for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the proof artifacts for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore in subagents with `subagent_type: "pstack:poteto-agent"` and an explicit model per the Subagents section (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill). Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, write the file under the agent store (`~/.claude/orchestrate/<slug>/docs/`). Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. Pick between `playbooks/autopilot-full.md` and `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` per the rule at the end of `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`. A standing program takes `playbooks/orchestrate.md`. The execution playbook owns base selection, topology changes, and merge authority. Do not copy its rebase steps into the plan.
5. Write under `/technical-writing` in full, then `/unslop`. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Run `node skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` from the installed plugin and fix every line it prints (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (the **prove-it-works** principle skill). Every verification block opens with that rule. The live block is mandatory. Ten lanes on the configured `swarm workers` model at the PR head drive the real product through its driver skill, per the **swarm** skill. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, an evidence artifact path, and a pass predicate. Choose evidence for the product: screenshots for UIs, terminal output for CLIs, request/response and side-effect records for services, or public-API consumer results for libraries. The **Regression lane against trunk** runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that fact and gate the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for.

**Driver skill.** Select it through the Non-negotiables and put the resolved skill path or exact commands in each live lane's boot recipe. Native mobile uses whatever simulator-driving skill the repo has. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no driver skill is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md` from the installed plugin. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] On the operator's go, write this exact text into the standing orders and restate it in your todolist. "<The plan path, the PR ids in order, the verification rule, who merges, and the done condition.>"
- [ ] Read these from the installed plugin at program start. Re-read them at every tick.
  - [ ] `skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `skills/swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `<driver skill path>`
  - [ ] `skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `skills/<each other leaf skill the program uses>/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Arm the hourly audit tick as a real `/loop` in dynamic mode, which schedules its own wake-up rather than blocking on a sleep. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the execution playbook from the installed plugin and the standing objective. Audit the operation against both and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then post a short status message to the operator in chat only when the audit found a tracked change that no earlier status message reported, such as a PR opened, a code-ready head, a round launched or closed, a verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision only the operator can make. Name every such change and nothing else. Do not repeat a table, the merged list, or an unchanged blocker. If the audit found none, end the turn with no reply text. Either way, log this tick's row in your decision trail. The row names the items reported, or none."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change a visual interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. For nonvisual changes, post the matching execution artifacts and state whether the operator requires a review gate.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`; if `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr` for every PR operation. Record any fallback to `gh`. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, per **Opening a PR**. Use the run's built-in PR tool when it has one, else `origin pr create --status open --base <base-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <base-branch>` according to the resolved forge. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run `/deslop` before each commit and `/no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every review-bot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Before the code-ready report and babysit, and again after merge prep, record the base and head SHAs prepared by the topology owner under the execution playbook.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the code-ready head SHA and at each later push that changes the patch, run the swarm per `skills/swarm/SKILL.md`. One gates lane. The ten live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. Two or more audit lanes, each with its own focus, that read the diff and the receipts and distrust the PR body. The root audits the receipts in the merge-ready report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs in its own worktree at the PR head. Drive through the skill path or exact commands recorded in this boot recipe.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Build or start the target and any required dependencies. Confirm it is ready. For a library, prepare its consumer.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the driver skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every evidence artifact under `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/` and return its paths with the report. Name the format for each lane, such as a screenshot, terminal transcript, request/response record, or consumer output.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Ten lanes on the configured `swarm workers` model at the PR head, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 4. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 5. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 6. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 7. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 8. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<artifact path>`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** <Visual. or Nonvisual.> The operator reviews before merge. Keep only the boxes for the selected kind below. If no operator review is required, replace this body with `None.` and remove its boxes.

- [ ] For visual interaction changes, copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png` and record a 30 to 60 second video at `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Save `<evidence path>` from lane <n> for a nonvisual change and the operator's review. Do not invent screenshots or a video for a product with no UI.
- [ ] Post the applicable evidence in chat. If review-gated, stop at merge-ready and wait for the operator's click. Otherwise follow the execution playbook's merge authority.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] Base and verdict are current under the execution playbook and the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>

## Close the program
