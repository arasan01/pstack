# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and do the work under it.

This file maps questions to the installed skills, playbooks, and native operations reference that own the answers. Read the matching source before answering. The local links point into `skills/`, so give the user the repository copy: `https://github.com/arasan01/pstack/blob/main/skills/` followed by its path relative to the skills root. This repository is private, so those links require access; do not describe them as public.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- For model questions, inspect native model roles and agent settings per [`setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md); no pstack model sheet or routing hook is required.
- No project `verify` or `verify-*` skill or other app harness means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.
- No formal verification skill means no property is checked beyond the cases tests reach. Mention [`/create-formal-verification-skill`](../create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) for races and invariants. If verified code changed after its recorded sync commit, mention [`/maintain-formal-verification-skill`](../maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Native configuration already owns its models through `modelRoles`.

## Get set up

1. Install the pstack package into oh-my-pi (`omp install .`).
2. Read [`/setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md) to inspect native configuration. Invoke skills explicitly.
3. Offer a first task prompt with a goal and a check that can pass or fail, per [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md). Setup can also offer the project verification and formal verification skills when they are missing.

Before giving instructions or adapting a recipe, read the [native operations reference](../poteto-mode/references/omp-tools.md) when applicable.

If cost is the worry, explain the extra work from subagents and review panels. Inspect native model roles, agent settings, and delegation limits; pstack does not set a separate budget. Save `/poteto-mode` for work that needs its full workflow.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one.

Invoke `poteto-mode` explicitly for each new task. Mid-chat, "new task" makes the mode match a fresh playbook. For subagent defaults, read [poteto-mode's Subagents section](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md#subagents) and the [native operations reference](../poteto-mode/references/omp-tools.md).

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

| The user wants to | Skill |
|---|---|
| Do any non-trivial task with rigor | [`/poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) |
| Check that the agent understood their goal and the problem before it starts | [`/in-your-own-words`](../in-your-own-words/SKILL.md) |
| Get a prompt rewritten deeper, not bigger, before sending it: what a top professional would add, their raw material and methods, and an outside check. It returns the prompt and doesn't do the task | [`/sharpen`](../sharpen/SKILL.md) |
| Know how code works now, or where new code should live | [`/how`](../how/SKILL.md) |
| Know why code is shaped this way, or where a number came from | [`/why`](../why/SKILL.md) |

| Catch up on their own recent work on a topic | [`/recall`](../recall/SKILL.md) |
| Catch up on what changed in this chat since their last message, in plain words and small visuals, with every item waiting on them listed and decidable from the reply alone | [`/ketchup`](../ketchup/SKILL.md) |
| Catch up like `/ketchup`, in a short silent video of slides, with the waiting calls as text under it | [`/ketchup-video`](../ketchup-video/SKILL.md) |

| Settle types and module shape before code that crosses a function boundary | [`/architect`](../architect/SKILL.md) |
| Get several attempts at one brief, merged into the best one | [`/arena`](../arena/SKILL.md) |
| Run parallel checks over slices, or race workers | [`/swarm`](../swarm/SKILL.md) |
| Have several reviewers review a diff and try to break it | [`/interrogate`](../interrogate/SKILL.md) |
| Run a strict structural maintainability audit | [`/nuclear-code-quality-review`](../nuclear-code-quality-review/SKILL.md) |
| Fix a bug test-first when a cheap local test exists | [`/tdd`](../tdd/SKILL.md) |
| Apply TypeScript rules to `.ts` or `.tsx` work | [`/typescript-best-practices`](../typescript-best-practices/SKILL.md) |
| Strip comments before review, using a reviewer that didn't write them | [`/no-comments`](../no-comments/SKILL.md) |
| Clean AI tells out of prose | [`/unslop`](../unslop/SKILL.md) |
| Remove Japanese AI prose patterns or clean a code diff | [`/deslop`](../deslop/SKILL.md) |
| Write docs, an RFC, a README, a PR description, or a commit message to a standard | [`/technical-writing`](../technical-writing/SKILL.md) |
| Hear the last reply again in plain words | [`/bro`](../bro/SKILL.md) |
| Give agents a scripted way to drive the app and prove behavior | [`/create-verification-skill`](../create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Bring a verification skill and its feature map back in line with the app | [`/maintain-verification-skill`](../maintain-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Formally verify a race, invariant, or other property that tests rarely reach | [`/create-formal-verification-skill`](../create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Bring a formal verification back in line after the code it covers changed, and learn whether a failure is drift or a bug | [`/maintain-formal-verification-skill`](../maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Show a PM or designer what the user sees as a chart checked by a TLA+ model, with the shortest path to each state that breaks a rule | [`/statechart`](../statechart/SKILL.md) |
| Vet a performance number before reporting or acting on it | [`/benchmark-checklist`](../benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) |
| Run a large or cross-cutting change, or one to review after stepping away | [`/figure-it-out`](../figure-it-out/SKILL.md) |
| Keep a decision log during a run, and review it afterward | [`/show-me-your-work`](../show-me-your-work/SKILL.md) |

| Stop agents from repeating the same mistakes in this repo | [`/correct`](../correct/SKILL.md) |
| Find their way around pstack | `/poteto-help` |

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- There is no bundled product-specific driver. Use the project verification skill and native tools for the actual app, service, CLI, or library per poteto-mode's Non-negotiables.
- pstack has no orchestrate skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. If the slash menu shows an orchestrate command, another plugin provides it.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs [Autopilot-full](../poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-full.md). "stack them, don't ship" runs [Autopilot-stack](../poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-stack.md). Read the selected playbook's merge rules before explaining what runs unattended.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

Without `/poteto-mode`, a phrase such as "babysit this pr" can start pstack's standalone [`/babysit`](../babysit/SKILL.md) skill instead. The [Playbooks section](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md#playbooks) lists every playbook and when it applies. Read [Babysit](../poteto-mode/playbooks/babysit.md) or [Shipping](../poteto-mode/playbooks/shipping.md) for the PR workflow.

pstack has no planning skill. For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." The [Principles index](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md#principles) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | Invoke `poteto-mode` for each new task. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | Inspect native modelRoles and agent settings; pstack does not use an override sheet. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill didn't load on its own | Read its description and invoke it explicitly when needed; `/poteto-mode` doesn't run every skill. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Give each agent its own worktree. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | Read [Autonomous run](../poteto-mode/playbooks/autonomous-run.md). Give the run a check that can pass or fail. |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers, and [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) has prompts to adapt.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
